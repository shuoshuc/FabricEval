FabricEval supports interactive query and visualization of the network topology.
A topology can be loaded into the [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database.
Users can visualize the connection and network structure as a graph.

To interact with the network, users can use the [Cypher query language](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/).
For instance, users can: retrieve the ports of a switch, find the peer port of a
port, obtain all links between two clusters etc.

#### How to use Neo4j and Cypher
